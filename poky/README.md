## Instructions

This pipeline prototype is currently non-functional, except for the
unique circumstance where all of the commit subject lines between
origin/master and origin/master-next are all submitted in the format 
"<packagename>: <short description>". We are actively looking at making
the recipe list acquisition more sophisticated, e.g. by looking at the
filenames for files altered in patches or something similar.
