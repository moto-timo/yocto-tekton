## yocto-tekton

This is a repository of configuration files meant to assist in
maintaining the meta-python OpenEmbedded layer (part of the repository
at http://cgit.openembedded.org/meta-openembedded). It also serves as a
set of examples for setting up and creating such a pipeline using
Docker, Kubernetes, and Tekton.
