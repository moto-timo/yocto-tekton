## yocto-tekton

This is a repository of configuration files meant for maintaining the
layers of the [Yocto Project](https://www.yoctoproject.org/). It
originated as a simple set of Tekton pipeline resources for Kubernetes
that were (and are still) used to help maintain the [meta-python
layer](https://layers.openembedded.org/layerindex/branch/master/layer/meta-python/),
but it continues to evolve to support other layers and related
processes, in addition to serving as a set of examples for building
pipelines with Docker, k8s, and Tekton.

See the [instructions for configuring a k8s
cluster](k8s_instructions.md) to get started, or view each directory's
README.md to learn more about what they do.
